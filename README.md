# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

The dotfiles are managed by [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) and the bootstrap script by [brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew).

## Installation

Clone:

```
git clone git://github.com/stehlikio/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
```

Change directories:

```
cd ~/dotfiles
```

Run:

```
scripts/bootstrap
```

Once the dotfiles have been bootstrapped, you can just run ```rcup``` in the terminal to update the scripts.

## Thanks

Most of the inspiration for these dotfiles came from [holman's](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), [r00k's](https://github.com/r00k/dotfiles), [ryanb's](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles), and [thoughtbot's](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) dotfiles.
